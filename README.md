tvshows-rss2xml
===============

## What is it

It's a site that allows people to convert their custom RSS searches to a specific tvshows xml format. It support multiple parsers to customize XML output based on the site (added nyaa.eu as example).

The goal was allowing people to create their own XMLs and also allow people to share them with custom urls, but since TVShows seems to be very *special* about XML parsing, I'm going to try support the app itself.
